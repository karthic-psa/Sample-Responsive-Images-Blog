# Responsive Images Blog: final version #
A sample responsive images blog (Test for responsive images).

## Design ##
This version uses the picture element for art direction: different image crops are loaded, depending on viewport size.
The images still use `max-width: 100%` â€“ which means 'expand the image display size to fit the container, but no larger than the natural width of the image'.

## Instructions ##
1. Clone the repo or download the zip.
2. Open the ```index.html``` in the browser.

To use the grunt file, make sure that node/npm are installed.
Also, make sure the necessary packages used are installed. Then from the root directory run the command 'grunt' in the terminal.
