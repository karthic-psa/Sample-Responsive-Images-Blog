# Responsive Images Blog: final version #


This version uses the picture element for art direction: different image crops are loaded, depending on viewport size.



The images still use `max-width: 100%` – which means 'expand the image display size to fit the container, but no larger than the natural width of the image'.

Just open the 'index.html' in the browser.

To use the grunt file, make sure that node/npm are installed.
Also, make sure the necessary packages used are installed. Then from the root directory run the command 'grunt' in the terminal.
